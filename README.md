### Project Info

<p>
  The system proposed in this paper is an advanced solution for monitoring the gas and temperature levels whether in a domestic or production environment and make the readings visible from anywhere in the world, hence ensuring the safety of people working in that area. The technology behind this is Internet of Things (IoT), which is an advanced and efficient solution for connecting the things to the internet and to connect the entire world of things in a network. Which is possible by using ESP8266 with the Arduino IDE and interfacing with a MQ-2 Gas and TMP-35 temperature sensor Using web server programming the data is uploaded to Thingspeak.com. The Thingspeak.com shows data in the form of charts of different styles example bar chart, line graph. This project was developed to produce a prototype product of a web-based gas and temperature monitoring system that allows the user to continuously monitor the condition of a place. The enhancement from the existing system on the gas-temperature monitoring is that this prototype system allowed the data to be monitored anytime and anywhere from the Internet. This project is divided into two parts that involved with the hardware and software. The hardware part involves building the gas and temperature sensor board and software part involves written programs based on C language. The programs then are uploaded into the esp8266. This prototype of a Web-Based Gas-Temperature Monitoring has met all the objectives derived and planned. The project is considered successful and ready to be launched in the real system implementations
